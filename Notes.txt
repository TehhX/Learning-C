This text file contains notes for this repo. Word wrap should be turned on to view this file as intended. Take everything with a grain of salt. I will be omitting the most basic parts of the language which I have already noted in my Learning-Cpp repository.

- stdio.h contains the standard library's in/out functionality. It can be used with "#include <stdio.h>".

- printf(...) will print <...> to console. e.g. printf("Hello, world\n") will print "Hello, world" to console, and move to the next line.

- scanf(...) will take input from the console in the same vain as printf(...) outputs

- These are some of the print/scan format specifiers (taken from https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-data-types):
      TYPE | FSPEC
    -------+------
       int |    %d
     float |    %f
      char |    %c
    double |   %lf

- Loops, switches, if/else/else if statements etc work just the same as in C++

- Functions work just the same as in C++, same prototype and defining etc
